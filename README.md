# Smart-Graden-PCB
This project is a custom-designed PCB solution for smart garden applications. The board manages environmental monitoring and device automation using sensor data and enables remote interaction via Wi-Fi.

Power Supply System:
  *Primary power: 12V DC input via adapter.
  *Backup system: A solar panel charges a rechargeable battery.
  *Automatic power switchover: When the 12V input is lost, the system automatically switches to battery power to ensure uninterrupted operation.

Automated Control & Connectivity
The system continuously reads real-time data from connected sensors and performs automated actions based on predefined conditions
